# CSM - Text-to-Speech Made Easy

CSM (Conversational Speech Model) is a powerful text-to-speech system that generates natural-sounding voices from text. This fork adds enhanced user experience, improved performance, and Apple Silicon acceleration.

## 🚀 Getting Started in 30 Seconds

### Install CSM

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ericflo/csm.git
cd csm

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package
pip install -e .

# For Apple Silicon users (recommended for Mac)
pip install -e ".[apple]"
```

### Generate Your First Audio

```bash
# Generate speech
csm-generate --text "Hello, this is a test of the CSM speech model."

# Using Apple Silicon acceleration
csm-generate-mlx --text "Hello, this is a test of the CSM speech model."
```

Your generated audio is saved as `audio.wav` in the current directory.

## 🖥️ Command-Line Interface

CSM provides two commands for generating speech:

- `csm-generate`: Standard version (works on all platforms)
- `csm-generate-mlx`: MLX-accelerated version for Apple Silicon Macs

```bash
# Basic usage
csm-generate --text "Hello, world!"

# With longer duration (in milliseconds)
csm-generate --text "This is a longer example" --max-audio-length-ms 20000

# With different temperature (controls variability)
csm-generate --text "Creative variations" --temperature 1.2

# Save to a specific file
csm-generate --text "Save to a custom file" --output my-audio.wav

# Show detailed performance metrics
csm-generate-mlx --text "Benchmarking" --debug
```

## 📚 Python API

For integration into your Python applications:

```python
from csm.generator import load_csm_1b, Segment
import torchaudio

# Load the model (downloads automatically if needed)
generator = load_csm_1b(model_path=None, device="cuda")  # or "cpu" or "mps"

# Generate speech
audio = generator.generate(
    text="Hello, I'm the CSM model!",
    speaker=1,  # 0-9, corresponds to voice presets
    context=[],
    max_audio_length_ms=10_000,
    temperature=0.9,
)

# Save the audio
torchaudio.save("output.wav", audio.unsqueeze(0).cpu(), generator.sample_rate)
```

### Contextual Generation

CSM produces more natural speech when provided with context:

```python
# Create context segments
segments = [
    Segment(
        text="Hi there, how are you doing today?",
        speaker=0,  # First speaker
        audio=previous_audio_1  # Optional reference audio
    ),
    Segment(
        text="I'm doing great, thanks for asking!",
        speaker=1,  # Second speaker
        audio=previous_audio_2
    )
]

# Generate a response continuing the conversation
response_audio = generator.generate(
    text="That's wonderful to hear. What have you been up to?",
    speaker=0,  # First speaker again
    context=segments,  # Provide conversation context
    max_audio_length_ms=15_000,
)
```

## 🍎 Apple Silicon Acceleration

### Model Architecture

CSM consists of two main components:

1. **Backbone**: A 1B parameter Llama 3.2 transformer for processing text and encoding context
2. **Audio Decoder**: A 100M parameter Llama 3.2 decoder for generating audio tokens

The model generates audio by:

1. Encoding text and optional audio context
2. Generating RVQ (Residual Vector Quantization) tokens using the dual transformer architecture
3. Decoding tokens to waveform using the Mimi codec

### Performance

- **Sample Rate**: 24kHz high-quality audio
- **Generation Speed**: ~2-3 frames per second on Apple Silicon (~0.3-0.4s per frame)
- **Watermarking**: All generated audio includes an inaudible watermark

### MLX Acceleration Architecture

The MLX acceleration is implemented through a sophisticated architecture optimized for Apple Silicon:

#### Core Components (`src/csm/cli/mlx_components/`)

- **Generator**: Pure MLX text-to-speech pipeline with optimized token generation
- **Transformer**: MLX-optimized transformer with custom attention mechanisms
- **Sampling**: High-fidelity token sampling that precisely matches PyTorch distributions
- **Model Wrapper**: Efficient PyTorch to MLX model conversion with BFloat16 support
- **Config**: Voice preset management optimized for MLX performance characteristics
- **Utils**: Performance profiling and compatibility verification

#### Advanced Implementation

- **Gumbel-Max Sampling**: Precise implementation of the Gumbel-max trick for categorical sampling
- **Optimized KV-Cache**: Specialized key-value cache designed for MLX's memory model
- **Core Tensor Operations**: Carefully crafted low-level operations that work around MLX constraints
- **Token Distribution Analysis**: Comprehensive testing to ensure sampling matches PyTorch quality
- **Memory Optimization**: Intelligent array reuse and caching to minimize memory allocations

Each component was designed with both performance and accuracy in mind, enabling the system to achieve PyTorch-level audio quality while leveraging the full computational power of Apple Silicon's Neural Engine and GPU architectures.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does this model come with pre-trained voices?**

CSM includes support for 10 different speaker IDs (0-9) through the `--speaker` parameter. These are base voices without specific personality or character traits.

**Can I fine-tune it on my own voice?**

Fine-tuning capability is planned for future updates. Currently, CSM works best with the included speaker IDs.

**Does it work on Windows/Linux?**

Yes! CSM works on all platforms through the standard `csm-generate` command. The `csm-generate-mlx` command is Mac-specific for Apple Silicon acceleration.

**How much GPU memory does it need?**

The 1B parameter model works well on consumer GPUs with 8GB+ VRAM. For CPU-only operation, 16GB of system RAM is recommended.

**Does it support other languages?**

CSM is primarily trained on English, but has some limited capacity for other languages. Your mileage may vary with non-English text.
